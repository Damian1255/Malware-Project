WIP/Things to do
- Training a neural network model with keras.
- Hashing and/or limit the no. of Opcodes.
- Experiment and perform dimension reduction or feature selection to reduce the number of features without sacrifcing too much performance.
- Experiment with feature engineering techinques to improve model performance.
- Model tuning.
- Set cutoff to 200 or 100
- Work on larger data
