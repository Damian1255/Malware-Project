1. Ensure there is a folder containing malware samples from each famaliy located in their respective subfolders.
2. Run 'subprocessor.py' to generate the necessary files for the training and testing of the model.
3. Run 'merger.ipynb' to merge the files generated by 'subprocessor.py' into a single dataset.
4. Run 'common_traits.ipynb' to generate the common traits of the dataset and evaluate the performance of the model.
